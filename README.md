FBLA PROJECT!!!
we are all competitors from the 2024-2025 national convention in anaheim for different things
This is our entry for this year and we are using components from 3d prints we designed ourselves and raspberry pi's from microcenter and christmas LAST year
This design is meant to be used in cohesion with our product nicknamed the snugbit
there are 6 buttons including the power button  
this should help kids understand how to take care of a pet by teaching resposibility
